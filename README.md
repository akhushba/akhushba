Hello!

My name is Amna Khushbakht and I'm a second-year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
I'm currently expanding my coding skills, and researching about the tech industry, looking to make a positive impact on the world around us someday through the diverse, revolutionary sphere that our software exists in today.
